## Welcome to buy-a-brew

__In Brief:__ 

This is a project made to demonstrate my Front End development ability in React JS. Made over the course of a couple evenings, buy-a-brew showcases a variety of modern techniques that make UI development such an amazing field to be working in! These range from implementing React Contexts to handle the global webstore for the Shopping Cart, to utalising bootstrapping libraries like Material UI to support rapid prototyping by quickly implementing global theming and existing, beautiful, opensourced components.

## Where could we go next?

__If I had more time, I would...__

1. Fix the remove from cart function to remove unique records

2. Add a counter to the cart entries to enable multiple purchases

3. Set the state for each buy now animation to be unique in the BeerList component

4. Add a catch so when a new item is added it cancels the checkout process (if active) 

5. Add a cancel checkout button to enable users to back out of transactions

6. Fix 'swipe left and right to navigate' as MUI components seem to disrupt it.

7. Impliment remaining UI features (and potentially iterate on designs)



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
