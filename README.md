## Welcome to buy-a-brew

__In Brief:__ 

This is a project made to demonstrate my Front End development ability in React JS (aimed at mobile users). Made over the course of a couple evenings, buy-a-brew showcases a variety of modern techniques that make UI development such an amazing field to be working in! These range from implementing React Contexts to handle the global webstore for the Shopping Cart, to utalising bootstrapping libraries like Material UI to support rapid prototyping by quickly implementing global theming and existing, beautiful, opensourced components.

## Where could we go next?

__If I had more time, I would...__

1. Fix the remove from cart function to remove unique records

2. Add a counter to the cart entries to enable multiple purchases

3. Set the state for each buy now animation to be unique in the BeerList component

4. Add a catch so when a new item is added it cancels the checkout process (if active) 

5. Add a cancel checkout button to enable users to back out of transactions

6. Fix 'swipe left and right to navigate' as MUI components seem to disrupt it.

7. Add in media queries to format the MUI grids correctly for dynamic browser viewing

8. Impliment remaining UI features (and potentially iterate on designs)
